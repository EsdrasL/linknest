## Did you use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? If so, how?

Yes, AI tools were used to improve productivity, create visual identity and solve specific problems or errors. Examples of usage:

- Create visual design, colors and logo for the app
- Help implement visual components
- Given test scenarios, implement unit testing
- Help to setup docker for the Firebase Emulator
- Reason about architectural decisions

## What did you build or decide manually?

Especially the architecture, use cases, authentication, user actions and infrastructure implementations were built manually.

## Where did you need to think critically or make decisions beyond AI suggestions?

I evaluated the given problem and chose technologies that aligned with both short-term goals and long-term maintainability. For example, I selected React and Next.js to support server components, routing, and data fetching in a unified model. Also, designed a clean, modular architecture to allow for scalability, separation of concerns, and easier testing. This included structuring components and business logic in a way that AI tools canâ€™t automatically infer from the problem requirements alone.

## What would you improve with more time?

Better user experience, more features for link management, better authentication service and more unit testing.
